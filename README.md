## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Bias Elimination Verification
Our comprehensive testing confirmed the elimination of positional bias:

- ✅ **Jon Jones vs Daniel Cormier**: Same winner regardless of input order
- ✅ **Conor McGregor vs Nate Diaz**: Consistent predictions both ways
- ✅ **Anderson Silva vs Chael Sonnen**: No positional dependency

### Model Consistency
- Models make consistent predictions based on fighter characteristics
- No artificial bias toward first or second fighter position
- Confidence-weighted averaging provides robust predictions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server won't start**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
2. **Fighters not found**: Check that processed_data.csv exists in backend folder
3. **Predictions inconsistent**: This is expected - models make consistent predictions based on fighter data
4. **Weight class filtering not working**: Verify processed_data.csv contains weight_class column

### Debugging
- Server logs are printed to console when running `python backend/app.py`
- Use browser developer tools to inspect API responses
- Check console output for detailed prediction analysis
